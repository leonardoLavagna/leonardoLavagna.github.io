I've just joined the Open Sicence Platform [Qeios](https://www.qeios.com/). It is an  open-access, open peer review, academic publishing platform. Publishing on Qeios is free and doesnâ€™t rely on editors to accept or reject papers. Instead, reviewers openly evaluate papers after publication, offering feedback to improve the work and guide readers on its quality. This post-publication peer review system allows broad participation, highlighting strong research and limiting the spread of flawed studies, and I believe it to be a kind of alternative to the many flaws current academic publishing has displayed over and over. If you are interested you can check my first contribution on Qeios [here](https://www.qeios.com/read/VODE1P).
