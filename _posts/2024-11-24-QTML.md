I'm going to attend the 8th International Conference on Quantum Techniques in Machine Learning where we are presenting three results:
1) a Quantum Generative Modeling based on a Straightforward State Preparation (mor on this later...)
2) an Enhanced version of the Quatum Approximate Optimization Algotrithm with an Ansatz and Blockwise Optimization (also more on this later...)
3) a Quantum-Classical Knowledge Distillaition Framework (wait for it...)
I'm really looking forward to it! If you happen to be in Melbourne in the week 24-30/11/2024 and want to have a chat let me know!
