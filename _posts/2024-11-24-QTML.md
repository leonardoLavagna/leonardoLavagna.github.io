I'm going to attend the [8th International Conference on Quantum Techniques in Machine Learning](https://qtml2024.org/) where we are presenting three results:
- a Quantum [Generative Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model) based on a Straightforward State Preparation (more on this later...)
- an Enhanced version of the [Quatum Approximate Optimization Algotrithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optimization_algorithms) with an Ansatz and Blockwise Optimization (also more on this later...)
- a Quantum-Classical [Knowledge Distillaition Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_distillation) (wait for it...)

I'm really looking forward to it! If you happen to be in Melbourne in the week 24-30/11/2024 and want to have a chat let me know!
