I'm going to present a work on Quantum Cryptography at the [2025 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS 2025)](https://2025.ieee-iscas.org/). The title of the talk is "Trade-Offs in Cryptosystems by Boolean and Quantum Circuits" where we have analized the security of cryptosystems based on trapdoor permutations against NISQ attacks. The materials will be available soon, and a preliminary schedule is available [here](https://epapers2.org/iscas2025/ESR/session_view.php?session_id=97).
