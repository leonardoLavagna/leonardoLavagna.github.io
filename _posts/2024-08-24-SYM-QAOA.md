[@NESYA](https://github.com/NesyaLab) we have have published a [preprint](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.15413) about graph symmetries, perturbations and the QAOA. Check the [associated blog post](https://lavagnaleo.wordpress.com/2024/09/12/on-the-effects-of-small-graph-perturbations-in-themaxcut-problem-by-qaoa) to know more about this article.
