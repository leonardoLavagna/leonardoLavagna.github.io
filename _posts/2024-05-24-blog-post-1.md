[@NESYA](https://github.com/NesyaLab) we have introduced a novel [variational quantum algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09265) built upon the established [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028). Since the known [parameter fixing strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05288) imposes some constraints to enhance tractability at the cost of some expressive power, the proposed layerwise approach integrates it with the existing [Multi-Angle QAOA technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11455), which is characterized in turn by heightened expressiveness through an increased number of parameters, but with increased optimization challenges. Consequently, our approach, the layerwise-Multi-Angle QAOA (LMA-QAOA) combines the strengths of one variant with the limitations of the other, striking a balance in algorithmic design.

Combinatorial Optimization Problems, the MaxCut and the QAOA.
======
Like any QAOA-type method, the proposed LMA-QAOA aims to solve [combinatorial optimization problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization), especially [NP-hard problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) arising from [Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization) tasks of interest for real-world applications such as logistics, energy grids, social network modeling, warehouse location, and so forth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We can think of a combinatorial optimization problem as a triple $(\mathcal{P},f,Alg)$, where $\mathcal{P}$ is a finite set of $m$ (classical) logical propositions, $f:\{0,1\}^n\to \mathbb{Z}$ is the cost function associating a $n$-bit string $z$ to the number of satisfied clauses of the form $$f(z)=\sum_{P\in\mathcal{P}}f_P(z) \leq m,$$ with $f_P(z)=1$ if and only if $z=z_1z_2\dots z_n$ satisfy $P$, and $Alg$ is an optimization algorithm that finds $z'$ or $z''$ such that $f(z')=\max f(z)$ or $f(z'')=\min f(z)$, respectively.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since many combinatorial optimization problems arise from graph structures, we focused on a prototypical problem, the [MaxCut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut), where a graph $\Gamma=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices (nodes) $v_i\in V$ and $m\leq\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ undirected edges $\{i,j\}\in E$ is to be partitioned into two set of vertices $S$ and $V\setminus S$ such that the number of edges $E$ connecting the nodes in the two parts is maximal. Clearly, the MaxCut problem can be extended to graphs with weighted edges, and the general cost function of is: $$f(z)=\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}(1-z_iz_j),$$ where $w_{ij}=w_{ji}>0$ is the weight associated to the edge between node $v_i$ and node $v_j$, $z_i=1$ when $v_i\in S$, $z_i=0$ otherwise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A QUBO problem can be mapped to an observable $H$ corresponding to the Hamiltonian of the [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model), in the case of the MaxCut $H$ has the form $$H(\sigma)=\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}(\mathbf{1}-\sigma_z^{(i)}\sigma_z^{(j)}),$$
where the optimal solutions correspond to fundamental states of $H(\sigma)$, retrievable via [quantum adiabatic computations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_quantum_computation).
