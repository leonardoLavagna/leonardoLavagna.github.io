[@NESYA](https://github.com/NesyaLab) we have introduced a novel [variational quantum algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09265) built upon the established [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028). Since the known [parameter fixing strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05288) imposes some constraints to enhance tractability at the cost of some expressive power, the proposed layerwise approach integrates it with the existing [Multi-Angle QAOA technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11455), which is characterized in turn by heightened expressiveness through an increased number of parameters, but with increased optimization challenges. Consequently, our approach, the layerwise-Multi-Angle QAOA (LMA-QAOA) combines the strengths of one variant with the limitations of the other, striking a balance in algorithmic design.

Combinatorial Optimization Problems, the MaxCut and the QAOA.
======
Like any QAOA-type method, the proposed LMA-QAOA aims to solve combinatorial optimization problems, with a particular focus on achieving [quantum advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy), especially for [NP-hard problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) such as are many important [Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization) tasks, which arise in many real-world applications such as logistics, energy grids, social network modeling, warehouse location, and so forth.
