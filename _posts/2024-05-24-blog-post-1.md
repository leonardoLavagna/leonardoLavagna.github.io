[@NESYA](https://github.com/NesyaLab) we have introduced a novel [variational quantum algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09265) built upon the established [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028). Since the known [parameter fixing strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05288) imposes some constraints to enhance tractability at the cost of some expressive power, the proposed layerwise approach integrates it with the existing [Multi-Angle QAOA technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11455), which is characterized in turn by heightened expressiveness through an increased number of parameters, but with increased optimization challenges. Consequently, our approach, the layerwise-Multi-Angle QAOA (LMA-QAOA) combines the strengths of one variant with the limitations of the other, striking a balance in algorithmic design.

Combinatorial Optimization Problems, the MaxCut and the QAOA.
======
Like any QAOA-type method, the proposed LMA-QAOA aims to solve combinatorial optimization problems, with a particular focus on achieving [quantum advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy), especially for [NP-hard problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) such as are many important [Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization) tasks, which arise in many real-world applications such as logistics, energy grids, social network modeling, warehouse location, and so forth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; we can think of a combinatorial optimization problem as a triple $(\mathcal{P},f,Alg)$, where $\mathcal{P}$ is a finite set of $m$ (classical) logical propositions, $f:\{0,1\}^n\to \mathbb{Z}$ is the cost function associating a $n$-bit string $z$ to the number of satisfied clauses of the form $$f(z)=\sum_{P\in\mathcal{P}}f_P(z) \leq m,$$ with $f_P(z)=1$ if and only if $z=z_1z_2\dots z_n$ satisfy $P$, and \textsc{Alg} is an optimization algorithm that finds $z^*$ or $z^{**}$ such that $f(z^*)=\max f(z)$ or $f(z^{**})=\min f(z)$, respectively. Such problems arise naturally in many important applications like graphs coloring, subsets covering, and scheduling. Moreover, since many NNs applications involve the minimization of a loss function, it is often possible to rewrite the associated training process as a combinatorial optimization task.
