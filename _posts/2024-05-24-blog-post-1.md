[@NESYA](https://github.com/NesyaLab) we have introduced a novel [variational quantum algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09265) built upon the established [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028). Since the known [parameter fixing strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05288) imposes some constraints to enhance tractability at the cost of some expressive power, the proposed layerwise approach integrates it with the existing [Multi-Angle QAOA technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11455), which is characterized in turn by heightened expressiveness through an increased number of parameters, but with increased optimization challenges. Consequently, our approach, layerwise-Multi-Angle QAOA combines the strengths of one variant with the limitations of the other, striking a balance in algorithmic design.
