[@NESYA](https://github.com/NesyaLab) we have introduced a novel [variational quantum algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09265) built upon the established [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028). Since the known [parameter fixing strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05288) imposes some constraints to enhance tractability at the cost of some expressive power, the proposed layerwise approach integrates it with the existing [Multi-Angle QAOA technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11455) (MA-QAOA), which is characterized in turn by heightened expressiveness through an increased number of parameters, but with increased optimization challenges. Consequently, our approach, the layerwise-Multi-Angle QAOA (LMA-QAOA), combines the strengths of one variant with the limitations of the other, striking a balance in algorithmic design.

Combinatorial Optimization Problems, the MaxCut and the QAOA.
======
Like any QAOA-type method, the proposed LMA-QAOA aims to solve [combinatorial optimization problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization), especially [NP-hard problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) arising from [Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization) tasks of interest for real-world applications such as logistics, energy grids, social network modeling, warehouse location, and so forth. We can think of a combinatorial optimization problem as a triple $(\mathcal{P},f,Alg)$ where $\mathcal{P}$ is a finite set of $m$ (classical) logical propositions, $f=f(z)$ is the cost function associating a $n$-bit string $z$ to the number of satisfied clauses of the form $f(z)=\sum_{P\in\mathcal{P}}f_P(z) \leq m$, with $f_P(z)=1$ if and only if $z=z_1z_2\dots z_n$ satisfy $P$, and $Alg$ is an optimization algorithm that finds $z'$ or $z''$ such that $f(z')=\max f(z)$ or $f(z'')=\min f(z)$, respectively. Since many combinatorial optimization problems arise from graph structures, we focused on a prototypical problem, the [MaxCut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut), where a graph $\Gamma=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices (nodes) $v_i\in V$ and $m\leq\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ undirected edges $(i,j)\in E$ is to be partitioned into two set of vertices $S$ and $V\setminus S$ such that the number of edges connecting the nodes in the two parts is maximal. Clearly, the MaxCut problem can be extended to graphs with weighted edges, and the general cost function of is $f(z)=\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}(1-z_iz_j)$, where $w_{ij}=w_{ji}>0$ is the weight associated to the edge between node $v_i$ and node $v_j$, $z_i=1$ when $v_i\in S$, $z_i=0$ otherwise. A QUBO problem can be mapped to an observable $H$ corresponding to the Hamiltonian of the [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model), in the case of the MaxCut $H$ has the form $H(\sigma)=\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}(1-\sigma_z^{(i)}\sigma_z^{(j)})$,where the optimal solutions correspond to fundamental states of $H(\sigma)$, retrievable via [quantum adiabatic computations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_quantum_computation), in particular, with QAOA, following the steps summarized below.

1. Choose [basis encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10375) $z\to |z\rangle$ and prepare an initial state $|\psi_0\rangle$ as a uniform superposition $|\psi_0\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{z}|z\rangle$, where the sum is extended over all standard basis elements of $(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}$ encoding the bit strings $z$.
2. Map $f(z)$ to $f(\sigma)$ by promoting each binary variable $z_i$ to a [Pauli Z-gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate) $\sigma_z^{(i)}$, then define the following unitary operator by considering, for every integer $k=1,\dots, p$, a rotation $U_f(\gamma_k)=e^{-i\gamma_k f(\sigma)}$ that is a product of $m$ terms. Note that $f(\sigma)$ has the form of a quantum Ising Hamiltonian.
3. For every $k=1,\dots, p$ choose a mixer operator, which is another rotation $U(\beta_k)=e^{-i\beta_k\sum_{j=1}^n \sigma_x^{(j)}}$ given as a product of $n$ terms, each of which is a [Pauli X-gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate) with rotation angle $\beta_k$.
4. Let $|\gamma\beta\rangle:=U(\beta_p)U_f(\gamma_p)\cdot\dots\cdot U(\beta_{1})U_f(\gamma_{1})|\psi_0\rangle$ be the evolved state and let $F_p$ be the expectation of $f$ with respect to this state obtained by repeated measurements, that is $F_p(\gamma,\beta):=\langle \gamma\beta| f(\sigma)\ |\ \gamma\beta\rangle$.
5. Pass $F_p$ to a classical optimizer to get an updated set of parameters $\gamma',\beta'$ and repeat the process starting from the previous steps, updating the number of layers $p\to p+1$. Stop when the approximation ratio $r_{C,C'}$, which depends on the quotient of $C'=F_p(\gamma',\beta')$ by the true optimal solution $C$ of the problem (or a reasonable upper bound) is as close as 1 as desired.

When there is a different rotation angle for each node and each edge, we have the MA-QAOA variant, which has an increased expressive power thanks to the extended number of parameters, as shown below.

1. For every $l=1,\dots, p$ define two arrays of parameters $\gamma_l=(\gamma_{lh})$, where $1\leq h\leq m$ is limited by the number $m$ of clauses (edges), and $\beta_l=(\beta_{lk})$ where $1\leq k\leq n$ is limited by the number $n$ of qubits (nodes).
2. For every $l=1,\dots, p$ substitute $U(\beta_l)$ with $U(\beta_l)$ and substitute $U_f(\gamma_l)$ with $U_f(\gamma_l)$, then execute the corresponding variational quantum circuit to get the approximate solution $F_p(\gamma,\beta):=\langle \gamma\beta| f(\sigma)|\gamma\beta\rangle$, where $\gamma=(\gamma_1,\dots, \gamma_p)$ and $\beta=(\beta_1,\dots, \beta_p)$.

Unfortunately such powerful methodologies involve a gread number of parameters which are hard to optimize and update, due to the complex structure of the cost function $F_p$ arising from the corresponding quantum circuits, often displaying an exponential number of local optima. In this sense, parameters' classical training can be carried out following different strategies. Besides the random approach, where at each layer random angles are drawn, other possibilities are: a symmetry-driven approach, where the space of parameters is reduced following the (classical) symmetries of the problem; a grid-search approach; a layerwise approach where, at each step, new parameters are chosen taking into account the result of previous optimization steps. In the proposed LMA-QAOA, successively introduced, we focus on parameter fixing strategies in order to reduce the optimization difficulties associated with the MA-QAOA circuit. In fact, the symmetry-driven approach has shown [promising results in many applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04713), but it often involve non-trivial preprocessing thus adding an overhead to the quantum-classical computation.

Proposed LMA-QAOA Algorithm
======
To strike a balance between the expressive power granted by the MA-QAOA and the optimization capabilities associated to the classical algorithm $Alg$ that solves the considered QUBO problem, we propose a methodology that incorporates a parameter fixing strategy into the training of an MA-QAOA circuit. Let $f$ be the cost function of a combinatorial optimization problem with $m$ clauses and $n$ bits. For concreteness, consider the cost function $f$ of the MaxCut problem in its QUBO formulation given by the quantum Ising Hamiltonian $H(\sigma)$ defined above. Given $p\geq 1$, $l=1,\dots, p$, apply the MA-QAOA to get the corresponding circuit with $2l$ unitary gates given by the MA-QAOA cost operator and mixer operator, namely:

1. If $l=1$, execute the variational quantum circuit initialized with random parameters, then pass the resulting expected value $F_l(\gamma_l,\beta_l)=\langle\gamma_l\beta_l | H(\sigma)| \gamma_l\beta_l\rangle$ to a classical optimizer and get the updated values $\gamma_l',\beta_l'$.
2. If $l>1$, initialize the circuit with new parameters given by the following updating rule: fix the optimized angles $\gamma_{l-1}',\beta_{l-1}'$ in the previous step, extend them with a layer of random values $\gamma_l\in [0,2\pi)^m,\beta_l\in [0,\pi)^n$, then consider $\gamma_l:=(\gamma_{l-1}',\gamma_l)$, $\beta_l:=(\beta_{l-1}',\beta_l)$ to get $F_l(\gamma_l,\beta_l)=\langle \gamma_l\beta_l| H(\sigma)|\gamma_l\beta_l\rangle$.
3. Perform the classical optimization step on $F_l$ considering only the extended parameters $\gamma_l$ and $\beta_l$, in particular carry out a classical optimization step with the constrains $\gamma_{l-1}=\gamma_{l-1}'$ and $\beta_{l-1}=\beta_{l-1}'$.

*Example .* Consider the MaxCut problem on a graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. For the sake of concreteness, choose $p=1,2$ and define for $p=1$ the random parameters $\gamma_1=(\gamma_{11},\dots, \gamma_{1m})$ with $\gamma_{1j}\in [0,2\pi)$ and $\beta_1=(\beta_{11},\dots, \beta_{1n})$ with $\beta_{1j}\in [0,2\pi)$. Once $\beta_1$ and $\gamma_1$ have been drawn, build the MA-QAOA circuit given by alternating operators, the cost operator $U_f(\gamma_1)=e^{-i(\gamma_{11}f_1(\sigma)+\dots+\gamma_{1m}f_m(\sigma))}$, and the mixer operator $U(\beta_1)=e^{-i(\beta_{11}\sigma_x^{(1)}+\dots+\beta_{1n}\sigma_x^{(n)})}$. The resulting circuit when $p=1$ is then $|\gamma_1\beta_1\rangle=U(\beta_1)U(\gamma_1)|\psi_0\rangle$. From $|\gamma_1\beta_1\rangle$ we can build $F_1(\gamma_1,\beta_1)$ where, unlike in the QAOA case, $F_1$ will depend on $n+m$ angles. We can therefore perform the classical optimization step to obtain a new set of angles $\gamma_1',\beta_1'$ and, at this point, we can apply the layerwise approach. Fix $p=2$ and consider the updated parameters: $\gamma_2=(\gamma_1',\gamma_2)^T$, $\beta_2=(\beta_1', \beta_2)^T$, where $\gamma_2=(\gamma_{21},\dots, \gamma_{2m})$, with $\gamma_{2j}\in [0,2\pi)$ chosen randomly, and $\beta_2=(\beta_{21},\dots, \beta_{2n})$ with $\beta_{2j}\in [0,\pi)$ chosen randomly as well. Then, build a new MA-QAOA circuit with operators $U_f(\gamma_2)$ and $U(\beta_2)$ to be executed in series after the MA-QAOA circuit in the previous layer with operators $U(\beta_1')$ and $U_f(\gamma_1')$. Execute the layer $p=2$ circuit to get $F_2(\gamma_2,\beta_2)$, then pass $F_2$ to a classical optimizer, and so on.

The proposed LMA-QAOA technique consistently outperforms the basic QAOA in terms of approximation ratio for a wide range of tested graph types, and, in most instances, demonstrates comparable or slightly superior performance compared to the more expressive MA-QAOA variant. Additionally, the LMA-QAOA tends to yield results with lower standard deviation compared to both QAOA and MA-QAOA, for further details check the full paper.
