We study an hybrid quantum-classical Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) used to infer information about multidimensional time series. The main idea is to modify the GRU dynamics by incorporating a quantum reset, update, and output step in the classical GRU cell with a VQC. The results are incouraging, but are obtained on simulations, thus further study will be necessary.
