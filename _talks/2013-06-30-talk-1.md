Talk (in italian) concluding the residential stage in Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (LNF), supervised by Dott. Danilo Babusci. 
The topic I studied was the relationship between the quantization of the action functional and the value of Plank's constant, measured 
also experimentally during the stage using LEDs. The notes (written in italian) of the talk are available [here](https://geometrino.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/azione-1.pdf).
