Talk at the seminar “Advanced methods of averaging in Ordinary Differential Equations” organized by Prof. Alan Rendall at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz (Germany). The topic I discussed was about the Hill equation. The website of the event is available [here](https://www.analysis.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/mittelungsmethode/). The notes of the talk are available [here](https://geometrino.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/hill_equation.pdf).
