Talk at the seminar “Geometrie auf der Sphäre und im hyperbolischen Raum” organized by Prof. Margarita
Kraus at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz (Germany). The main point was to show that the isometry group of the
hyperbolic space is isomorphic to a subgroup of the Möbius group of the sphere. The notes of the talk are available [here](https://geometrino.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/isometrie-iperboliche-e-gruppo-di-moebius-della-sfera.pdf).
