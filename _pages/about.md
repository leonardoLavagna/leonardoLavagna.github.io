I'm a mathematician specialized in Data Science currently pursuing a PhD in Quantum Computing at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) at the [Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications (DIET)](https://web.uniroma1.it/dip_diet/en) in the [Neural Network Systems & Applications Laboratory (NESYA)](https://sites.google.com/view/nesya) (official academic webpage available [here](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/LEONARDO-LAVAGNA_nP1650170_IT.aspx)). You can reach me at **leonardo.lavagna@uniroma1.it** or in person (please take an appointment via e-mail first!) in [via Eudossiana 18 Building B first floor](https://diet.web.uniroma1.it/en/how-reach-us) room 111.


Before starting my journey in quantum computing I've worked as an IT consultant and as a data scientist. I am passionate about participating in innovative projects that contribute to the improvement of society and the environment. This is my personal website where I share my research and other work-related activities. This website is associated to technical blog [lavagnaleo.wordpress.com](https://lavagnaleo.wordpress.com/) and to the italian non-technical blog [geometrino.wordpress.com](https://geometrino.wordpress.com/).
