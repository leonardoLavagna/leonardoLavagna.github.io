I'm a mathematician specialized in data science currently pursuing a PhD in Quantum Computing at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) in the [NESYA](https://sites.google.com/view/nesya?authuser=0) multidisciplinary lab in the [Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications (DIET)](https://web.uniroma1.it/dip_diet/en). You can reach me at [llavagna@proton.me](llavagna@proton.me) (for personal communications) or at [leonardo.lavagna@uniroma1.it](leonardo.lavagna@uniroma1.it) (work and research related communications), or in person (please take an appointment first!) in [via Eudossiana 18 Building B first floor](https://web.uniroma1.it/dip_diet/en/dipdiet/department/how-reach-us).


Before starting my journey in quantum computing I've worked as an IT consultant and as a data scientist. I have working experience in modeling (biology, physics, statistics), bioinformatics, data analysis (machine learning, deep learning), cybersecurity (cryptography), optimization and software development. I enjoy multidisciplinarity, working both independently and in groups. More generally, I am passionate about participating in innovative projects that contribute to the improvement of society and the environment. Here I share some parts of my work as well as those projects I carry out in my free time and which are helping me grow, both personally and professionally.
